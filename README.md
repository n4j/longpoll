Longpoll is a Serveless platform to routinely perform health-check on your private EC2 instances and services hosted on them. The healthcheck statuses are put into CloudWatch alarms which then can be used to take preventive actions in case a service goes down.

Features in Pipeline
====================
- Support for MySQL and Redis checks
- Create a Serverless UI to configure checks
- One click CloudFormation template for performing deployment

## longpoll is still development phase and contributions are welcome :)
